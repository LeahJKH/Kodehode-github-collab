## getting too right folder space

<p>Why clone? well with cloning you get the connection too github automatically</p>
<p>first make sure you are in the correct filepath. this can be seen in the command line</p>

<p>here i can see that im in user inside leahj insiide documents and so on in the end i see my open folder is Kodehode-github-collab</p>
<p>this is a project folder so id wish for it too be in html css which means i need too step back once i can do this from the command line</p>

<p>writing cd .. will take me one folder out if i wanted too go back in id write cd [folder name]</p>
